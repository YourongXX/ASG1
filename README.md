# DESIGN PROCESS

# Target market for online shopping is quite diverse, it can range from toddlers all the way to elderly. It can be a buy of convenience, needs or want of the user.

# The targetted users of this online shopping website is actually young adults -> middle-aged adults. But why? Generally, adults have greater purchasing power because they have a stable income (disposable income). They also have to dress up for work, go-out or events like weddings and parties. Thus, I chose them as they are the customers that can bring in profits for the store.

# WHAT MAKES THIS WEBSITE STAND OUT COMPARED TO OTHER WEBSITES

# This website may not be as good as I am still a student learning. However, this website hits the basic requirement of a online clothing website and can be further improved on in the future. It includes a lot of different built-in features after researching many websites. This website aims to provide convenience and joyful customer experience for the customer so that they can shop easily and at ease.

# INSPIRATION FOR THIS PROJECT

# I chose to develop a clothing website because previously I've been scrolling popular online clothing store online such as SHEIN and NIKE . This made me curious and since there was an opportunity to try it out, I went with it. I enjoy shopping online too, so i think it would also help as I can think in two different perspective (Learned from IS Core Modules) . This double-assured me to choose a topic that i am interested in so that i will put in extra effort in completing it. E-Commerce, have also been a popular platform ever since the COVID-19 pandemic. People nowadays are often lazy to travel to far places to purchase their item. Thus,I see a potential in this market in generating profits and therefore, i chose online clothing store.
